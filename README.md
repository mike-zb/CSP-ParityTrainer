# Cale's CSP tracing trainer

Similar to Squanmate's [parity game](https://squanmate.cuber.pro/#/parity-game) for Cale's CSP tracing, but one color at a time is displayed.

Settings: 
- Show explanation: from [CubeMaster's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLVZlRQMbSU), show the color that gets removed.
- Manual Mode: manually switch to the next color.
- Delay: time the first two colors are shown before switching to the next (manual mode disabled only).
